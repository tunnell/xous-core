//! Xous Signal app entry point.
//!
//! Stage 8: first end-to-end glue. Construct a `PddbStore` (mock
//! backend in hosted mode; Stage 9 swaps in the real PDDB-backed
//! impl), spawn the manager worker thread, exchange a few commands
//! over the async-channel IPC pair, then shut down cleanly.
//!
//! Stage 1 was a smol-rs `LocalExecutor` smoke test — that work has
//! moved into the `xous-signal-bridge` worker, which uses the same
//! executor pattern. The hosted-mode test that drives this binary
//! prints "pong" and "whoami: <error string>" then exits — same
//! shape as the Renode smoke test ROADMAP §Stage 9 will assert on.
//!
//! See docs/ROADMAP.md Stage 8 for context.
